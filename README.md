# PROJECT LOGICHANDS

Logichands is a lightweight and modular command-line tool written in C that helps users perform logical operations and compound expression evaluations interactively.  
It’s designed to demonstrate structured programming, modularity, and Boolean logic concepts in a simple yet elegant way.

---

## 🧮 Features
| 🧠 Capability | 💡 Description |
|---------------|----------------|
| ✅ Logical Operations | Supports AND, OR, NOT, XOR |
| 🧩 Compound Expressions | Evaluate combined Boolean expressions |
| 🔁 Interactive Menu | User-friendly CLI for input and selection |
| ⚙️ Modular Code | Functions for readability and reusability |
| 💻 Portable | Works on any Linux terminal with a C compiler |

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
- Boolean logic and truth tables  
- Function-based modular design  
- Menu-driven CLI structure  
- Conditionals (`if-else`, `switch`)  
- User input handling with validation

## 🧩 LOGICHANDS - LOGICAL OPERATIONS TOOL 🧩

1. Perform Basic Logic Operation
2. Evaluate Compound Expression
3. Exit
```
Enter your choice: 1

Select Operation:
1. AND
2. OR
3. NOT
4. XOR

Enter first value (0/1): 1
Enter second value (0/1): 0

Result: 1 AND 0 = 0

```
