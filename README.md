### ⚡ Command-Line Logic Evaluator in C

**Logichands** is a lightweight and modular **command-line tool** written in **C** that helps users perform **logical operations** and **compound expression evaluations** interactively.  
It’s designed to demonstrate structured programming, modularity, and Boolean logic concepts in a simple yet elegant way.

---

## 🧮 Features
| 🧠 Capability | 💡 Description |
|---------------|----------------|
| ✅ Logical Operations | Supports AND, OR, NOT, XOR |
| 🧩 Compound Expressions | Evaluate combined Boolean expressions |
| 🔁 Interactive Menu | User-friendly CLI for input and selection |
| ⚙️ Modular Code | Functions for readability and reusability |
| 💻 Portable | Works on any Linux terminal with a C compiler |

🧩 LOGICHANDS - LOGICAL OPERATIONS TOOL 🧩

1. Perform Basic Logic Operation
2. Evaluate Compound Expression
3. Exit
```
Enter your choice: 1

Select Operation:
1. AND
